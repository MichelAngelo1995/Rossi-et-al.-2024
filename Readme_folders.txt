- Boutons analysis:
	Excel files and parallel fiber ROI files from all boutons (traces, F0, bootstrap failures, amplitudes, decay-time...).

- Control_iglusnfr_stability_time:
	Excel files from set1 and set2 boutons (i.e. imaged at t=0 and t+8min). Traces + amplitudes.

- GroupLinescan1_20Hz_10pulses_2.5mMCa:
	Example of imaged parallel fiber: linescan files (.tif), ROI file (parallel fiber + linescan), linescan coordinates file (.coord)
	and two-photon parameters file (.ini). Open with GIMLI script.
